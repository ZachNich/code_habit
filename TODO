CURRENT:        

IN PROGRESS:    Include associated problem with most recent solution on logged in home page.
                ** Done, but need to link the PROBLEM TITLE to the Profile page where user can view the problem and solution on the profile page.

TO DO:          Add tutorial to new user experience
                Style Sign In & Sign Up pages
                Add learning resources to each problem
                Add problem title to labit/habit pages
                Finish graph/visualization for consistency on profile page (bar graph? Calendar?)

ISSUES:         Some solutions are not accepted, mostly arrays (need to accept any array order?)
