Joe Notes:

Include associated problem with most recent solution on logged in home page.
Add UX clarity to modal 'continue' button to tell user their solution was saved.
Add all past user solutions to the profile page so the user can view their past work and progress.
Increase visibility of tests failed notification on habit/labit page.
