Joe Notes:

Include associated problem with most recent solution on logged in home page.
    ** Done, but need to link the PROBLEM TITLE to the Profile page where user can view the problem and solution on the profile page.
Add all past user solutions to the profile page so the user can view their past work and progress.
Increase visibility of tests failed notification on habit/labit page.
Add clarity as to what "lab it" and "habit" actually are (new problems and reviews)

Add tutorial to new user experience.
Separate 'preview upcoming problems' into 'upcoming problems' and 'upcoming reviews'

Current issues: 

Some solutions are not accepted, mostly arrays (need to accept any array order?)
Profile page design
Profile page stats not updating dynamically
Code editor expands horizontally instead of scrolling
