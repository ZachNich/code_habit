CURRENT:        

IN PROGRESS:    Include associated problem with most recent solution on logged in home page.
                ** Done, but need to link the PROBLEM TITLE to the Profile page where user can view the problem and solution on the profile page.

TO DO:          Add tutorial to new user experience
                Style Sign In & Sign Up pages
                Add learning resources to each problem
                Add problem title to labit/habit pages
                Finish graph/visualization for consistency on profile page (bar graph? Calendar?)

ISSUES:         Some solutions are not accepted, mostly arrays (need to accept any array order?)


8/8/20:

Add SM-2 timing to review calculations
Add functionality for burning reviews (if reviewed X times, review never shows again)
Add timer to lab it / habit pages and save time to DB
Fix the test cases for problems that aren't currently working (strings / arrays)
Style sign in / sign up pages
Add progress bar to habit (maybe lab it?) page
Add problem title to labit/habit pages
Add learning resources to labit/habit and DB
Add consistency graph on profile page (heatmap calendar like github, but just with true/false colors)
Tweak profile banner
Consolidate CodeHabit.js and AppViews.js and make sure correct component is used in index.js

THAT'S PROBABLY IT!! Save and record a demo because this alpha version is FINISHED.
