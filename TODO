CURRENT:        Add all past user solutions to the profile page so the user can view their past work and progress.
                Add graphs to Profile page using Chart.js
                    ** Line graph = days studied, Doughnut graph = solved problems, unsolved problems, reviews, Radar graph = Tags solved
                    ** Add tags to problems

IN PROGRESS:    Include associated problem with most recent solution on logged in home page.
                ** Done, but need to link the PROBLEM TITLE to the Profile page where user can view the problem and solution on the profile page.

TO DO:          Add tutorial to new user experience
                Style Sign In & Sign Up pages
                Add learning resources to each problem
                Add problem title to labit/habit pages

ISSUES:         Some solutions are not accepted, mostly arrays (need to accept any array order?)
                Profile page design
                Profile page stats not updating dynamically
                Code editor expands horizontally instead of scrolling
